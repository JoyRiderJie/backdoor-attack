This Github repository summarizes a list of **Backdoor Learning** resources.I will try my best to continuously maintain this Github Repository in a monthly manner.

#### Why is Backdoor Learning?

Backdoor learning is an emerging research area, which discusses the security issues of the training process towards machine learning algorithms. It is critical for safely adopting third-party training resources or models in reality.

Note: 'Backdoor' is also commonly called the 'Neural Trojan' or 'Trojan'.
